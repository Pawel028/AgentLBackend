       "['The 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder, commonly known as the Nirbhaya case, involved the gang rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South Delhi. The incident took place when Jyoti Singh, a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern, was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was travelling with her friend, Avnindra Pratap Pandey. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. She was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi for treatment and, as the public outrage mounted, the government had her transferred to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore eleven days after the assault, where she died from her injuries two days later.[3][4][5] The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country. Since Indian law does not allow the press to publish a rape victim\\'s name, the victim was widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning \"fearless\", and her struggle and death became a symbol of women\\'s resistance to rape around the world.[6][7]',\n",
       " \"All the accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody from possible suicide on 11 March 2013.[8] According to some published reports and the police, Ram Singh hanged himself, but the defence lawyers and his family allege he was murdered.[9] The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013.[10] On 10 September 2013, the four adult defendants ‚Äì Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Mukesh Singh (Ram Singh's brother) ‚Äì were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death.[11][12][13] In the death reference case and hearing appeals on 13 March 2014, Delhi High Court upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences.[14] On 18 December 2019, the Supreme Court of India rejected the final appeals of the condemned perpetrators of the attack.[15] The four adult convicts were executed by hanging on 20 March 2020.[16][7] The juvenile Mohammed Afroz was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility, as per the Juvenile Justice Act.[17]\",\n",
       " \"As a result of the protests, in December 2012, a judicial committee was set up to study and take public suggestions for the best ways to amend laws to provide quicker investigation and prosecution of sex offenders. After considering about 80,000 suggestions, the committee submitted a report which indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. In 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 was promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee, several new laws were passed, and six new fast-track courts were created to hear rape cases. Critics argue that the legal system remains slow to hear and prosecute rape cases, but most agree that the case has resulted in a tremendous increase in the public discussion of crimes against women and statistics show that there has been an increase in the number of women willing to file a crime report. However, in December 2014, two years after the attack, the victim's father called the promises of reform unmet and said that he felt regret in that he had not been able to bring justice for his daughter and other women like her.[18]\",\n",
       " \"The victims, a 22-year-old woman, Jyoti Singh, and her male friend were returning home on the night of 16 December 2012 after watching the film Life of Pi at PVR Select City Walk, Saket. They took an auto rickshaw to Munirka bus stand,[19] then boarded the bus at Munirka for Dwarka at about 9:30 pm (IST). There were only six others in the bus, including the driver. One of the men, identified as a minor, had called for passengers telling them that the bus was going towards their destination.[4][20] They took 10 rupees each as fare from both the victims. The victim's male friend became suspicious when the bus deviated from its normal route and its doors were shut. When he objected, the group of six men already on board, including the driver, taunted the couple, asking what they were doing alone at such a late hour.[21]\",\n",
       " 'During the argument, a scuffle ensued between her friend and the group of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked unconscious with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti to the rear of the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. A medical report later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration.[19] That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.[22][23][24]',\n",
       " 'According to police reports, Jyoti attempted to fight off her assailants, biting three of the attackers and leaving bite marks on the accused men.[25] After the beatings and rape ended, the attackers threw both victims from the moving bus. One of the perpetrators later cleaned the vehicle to remove evidence. Police impounded it the next day.[25][26]',\n",
       " 'The partially clothed victims were found on the road by a passerby at around 11 pm. The passerby called the Delhi Police who took the couple to Safdarjung Hospital, where Jyoti was given emergency treatment and placed on mechanical ventilation.[27] She was found with injury marks, including numerous bite marks, all over her body. According to reports, one of the accused men admitted to having seen a rope-like object, assumed to be her intestines, being pulled out of the woman by the other assailants on the bus. Two blood-stained metal rods were retrieved from the bus and medical staff confirmed that \"it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines\".[23][24]',\n",
       " 'Jyoti Singh was born in Delhi on 10 May 1990, the eldest of three children and the only daughter of a lower-middle-class family.[28] Her parents hailed from a small village in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh.[28] While Jyoti\\'s mother is a home-maker,[29] her father worked double shifts (two jobs) to support his family and send his children to good schools. In an interview, he related that as a youth, he had dreamed of becoming a schoolteacher, but his family could not afford to support his education beyond high school. After moving to Delhi, he worked at a pressure cooker factory,[30] as a security guard and eventually a luggage loader.[31] He said, \"when I left [his village] 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge.\"[31] He said, \"It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn\\'t? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school.\"[31][32]',\n",
       " \"Jyoti Singh graduated in physiotherapy from the Sai Institute of Paramedical & Allied Sciences in Dehradun, and had just applied for an intern's position at St Stephen's Hospital in Delhi.[30] She lived in Delhi and only sometimes visited her family's ancestral village.[32]\",\n",
       " 'In compliance with Indian law, the real name of the victim was initially not released to the media, so pseudonyms were used for her by various media houses instead, including Jagruti (awareness), Amanat (treasure), Nirbhaya (fearless one), Damini (lightning, after the 1993 Hindi Hit film) and Delhi braveheart.[33][34][35][36][37]',\n",
       " 'The male victim, Awindra Pratap Pandey, was a software engineer from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, who lives in Ber Sarai, New Delhi; he suffered broken limbs but survived.[38][39]',\n",
       " 'Delhi police registered a criminal case against the editor of a Delhi-based tabloid, Mail Today, for disclosing the female victim\\'s identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code.[40] Shashi Tharoor, then a union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, as a mark of respect for her courageous response, with the possibility of naming future laws after her.[41] Speaking to a British reporter on 5 January, the victim\\'s father was quoted as saying, \"We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn\\'t do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.\"[42] Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father\\'s reported quote and the victim\\'s name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name.[43] However, the following day Zee News quoted the father as saying, \"I have only said we won\\'t have any objection if the government uses my daughter\\'s name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one.\"[44] During a protest against the juvenile convict\\'s release on 16 December 2015, the victim\\'s mother stated that her daughter\\'s name was Jyoti Singh and she was not ashamed of disclosing her name.[45]',\n",
       " 'On 19 December 2012, Singh underwent her fifth surgery, which removed most of her remaining intestine. Doctors reported that she was in \"stable but critical\" condition.[46] On 21 December, the government appointed a committee of doctors to ensure she received the best medical care.[47] By 25 December, she remained intubated, on life support and in critical condition. Doctors stated that she had a fever of 102 to 103 ¬∞F (39 ¬∞C) and that internal bleeding due to sepsis was somewhat controlled. It was reported that she was \"stable, conscious and meaningfully communicative\".[48]',\n",
       " 'At a cabinet meeting chaired by then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 26 December, a decision was made to fly her to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore for further treatment. Mount Elizabeth is a multi-organ transplant specialty hospital.[49][50] Some doctors criticised the decision as political, questioning the need to transfer an intensive care unit (ICU) patient for organ transplants that were not scheduled for weeks or even months.[51][52] Government sources indicated that then Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, was personally behind the decision.[53] Hours earlier, then-Union Minister P. Chidambaram had stated that Jyoti was not in a condition to be moved.[54]',\n",
       " 'During the six-hour air-ambulance flight by to Singapore on 27 December, Jyoti suddenly went into a \"near collapse\", which a later report described as cardiac arrest.[55] The doctors on board inserted an arterial line to stabilise her, but she had been without a pulse and blood pressure for nearly three minutes and never regained consciousness in Singapore.[56]',\n",
       " 'On 28 December, at 11 am (IST), Jyoti\\'s condition was extremely critical. The chief executive officer of the Mount Elizabeth Hospital said that the victim suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection, and that she was \"fighting for her life.\"[55] Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she died at 4:45 am on 29 December, Singapore Standard Time (2:15 am, 29 December, IST; 8:45 pm, 28 December, UTC).[57] Her body was cremated on 30 December in Delhi under high police security. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), then the country‚Äôs main opposition party, criticised the high-security measures, stating that they were reminiscent of the Emergency era, during which civil liberties were suspended.[58] One of Jyoti\\'s brothers later remarked that the decision to fly her out to Singapore had come too late, and they had held high hopes for her recovery prior to her death.[28]',\n",
       " \"A Special Investigation Team was formed to investigate the case, which was led by Pramod Kumar Kushwaha, the Deputy Commissioner of Delhi Police's Special Cell.[59] Police found and arrested some suspects within 24 hours of the crime.[60] From recordings made by a highway CCTV, a description of the bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants with the help of the male victim, and used a mobile phone stolen from the two victims to find one of the assailants.[60]\",\n",
       " 'Six men were arrested in connection with the incident. They included 30-year-old Ram Singh, the bus driver, and his 26-year-old brother, Mukesh Singh, who were both arrested in Rajasthan. Ram and Mukesh Singh lived in Ravidas camp, a slum in South Delhi.[61] 20-year-old Vinay Sharma, an assistant gym instructor, and 19-year-old Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, were both arrested in UP and Bihar.[62] A 17-year-old juvenile named Mohammed Afroz, from Badayun, Uttar Pradesh,[63][64][65] was arrested at the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi. The juvenile had only met the others that day.[65] 28-year-old Akshay Thakur, who had come to Delhi seeking employment, was the final suspect to be arrested in Aurangabad, Bihar; he was married with one son at the time of his arrest.[62][66][67]',\n",
       " 'According to reports, the group had been eating and drinking together and \"having a party\" earlier in the day.[4] Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers[26] or even to operate in Delhi because of its tinted windows,[68] they decided to take it out \"to have some fun\".[4] A few hours before committing the gang rape, the attackers had robbed a carpenter. The carpenter was 35-year-old Ramadhir Singh (unrelated to Ram, Mukesh and Jyoti), who boarded the bus that was being driven by Mukesh Singh. The juvenile convict had lured him into the bus saying it was going to Nehru Place. He was then beaten up and robbed of his mobile phone and ‚Çπ1500 in cash. After robbing him, the group dumped him at the IIT Flyover. He reported the robbery to three police constables: Kailash, Ashok and Sandeep, who were passing nearby. They refused to take any action in response, saying that the crime scene wasn\\'t under their purview as they were from the Hauz Khas police station, and that he would have to report the incident to the station in Vasant Vihar.[21][69][70][71]',\n",
       " 'Shortly after the attacks, Pawan Gupta said he accepted his guilt and should be hanged.[72][73] Mukesh Singh, who was placed in Tihar Jail after his arrest, was assaulted by other inmates and was kept in solitary confinement for his own protection.[74]',\n",
       " 'Ram Singh was presented before the Metropolitan Magistrate on 18 December 2012.[75] He refused to participate in an identification process.[68] Investigation revealed a history of frequent drinking that resulted in \"blinding rage\", \"bad temper\", and quarrels with employers, that had led friends to call him \"mental\".[76] On 11 March, Ram Singh was discovered hanging from a ventilator shaft in his cell which he shared with 3 other prisoners, at about 5:45 a.m.[77] Authorities said it was unclear whether it was a suicide or a murder.[78][79][80]',\n",
       " 'The male victim, Awindra Pratap Pandey, testified in court on 19 December 2012.[81] Pandey recorded his statement with a sub-divisional magistrate at the Safdarjung Hospital on 21 December, in the presence of the Deputy Commissioner of police.[82] He was reportedly plagued with guilt and trauma over the incident.[83]',\n",
       " 'On 21 December, the government promised to file the charge sheet quickly and seek the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the perpetrators.[84] Following public outrage and a demand for a speedy trial and prosecution, on 24 December, the police promised to file the charge sheet within one week.[85] The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs met on 27 December to discuss the issue, and Union Home Secretary R. K. Singh and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar were summoned to appear.[86] The Delhi High Court approved the creation of five fast-track courts to try rape and sexual assault cases.[87] The first of the five approved fast-track courts was inaugurated on 2 January 2013 by Altamas Kabir, Chief Justice of India, in Saket court complex in South Delhi.[88]',\n",
       " 'On 21 December, the Delhi High Court reprimanded the Delhi police for being \"evasive\" in a probe status report providing details of officers on patrol duty in the area covered by the bus route.[89] A further court hearing on the matter was scheduled for 9 January 2013.[89] The following day, the Delhi Police initiated action against three Hauz Khas police station personnel for their inaction in responding to the robbery of the carpenter that took place earlier on the bus in the day.[21] On 24 December, two Assistant Commissioners of Police were suspended for failing to prevent the gang rape incident.[90]',\n",
       " 'The juvenile defendant Mohammed Afroz,[91][92][93][94] whose name was later changed to Raju in the media due to his age, was declared as 17 years and six months old on the day of the crime by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), which relied on his birth certificate and school documents. The JJB rejected a police request for a bone ossification (age determination) test for a positive documentation of his age.[95][96][97]',\n",
       " 'On 28 January 2013, the Juvenile Justice Board determined that Afroz would not be tried as an adult. A petition launched by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy seeking the prosecution of the minor as an adult due to the violent nature of his alleged crime was rejected by the JJB.[98][99][100] The minor was tried separately in a juvenile court.',\n",
       " \"A verdict in the case was scheduled to be announced on 25 July,[101] but was deferred until 5 August[102] and then deferred again to 19 August.[103] On 31 August, he was convicted of rape and murder under the Juvenile Justice Act and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility, inclusive of the eight months he spent in remand during the trial.[104] Reportedly, Jyoti's younger brother had impulsively tried to attack the juvenile convict after hearing the verdict but the crowd in the courtroom managed to restrain him.[105] The juvenile was released on 20 December 2015.[106]\",\n",
       " 'For the rehabilitation and mainstreaming of Afroz as mandated by the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 management committees were set up before the release of juvenile convicts. Accordingly, a \\'post-release plan\\' was submitted to the Delhi high court in December 2015. The plan was prepared and submitted by the management committee, headed by the officer of the District Child Protection Unit, and had recommended that \"(Afroz) should lead a new life with a new identity provided by the appropriate government as applicable in his case if permissible to avoid any backlash or violent reaction\".[107] According to the report, the juvenile had learnt cooking and tailoring while staying in the reform house.[107] The report further said that Afroz would need a tailoring shop, a sewing machine and other tailoring equipment. The report also mentioned that a one-time grant of ‚Çπ10,000 (US$120) from the government should be sufficient to support him initially.[107][108] The department of women and child development (WCD) of the government stated that it would provide the money and would arrange the machine from an NGO.[109] The Afroz\\'s family had ostracized him for the crime and refused to accept him.[110] However, after his release it was reported that he was working as a cook.[111]',\n",
       " \"Five days after Jyoti's death, on 3 January 2013, the police filed charges against the five adult men for rape, murder, kidnapping,[112][113] destruction of evidence, and the attempted murder of the woman's male companion.[1] Senior lawyer Dayan Krishnan was appointed as the special public prosecutor.[114] Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta denied the charges. Some of the men had confessed earlier; however, their lawyers said that their clients had been tortured and that their confessions had been coerced.[115][116]\",\n",
       " 'On 10 January, one of their lawyers, Manohar Lal Sharma, said in a media interview that the victims were responsible for the assault because they should not have been using public transportation and, as an unmarried couple, they should not have been on the streets at night. He went on to say: \"Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl without respect.\"[117] He also called the male victim \"wholly responsible\" for the incident because he \"failed in his duty to protect the woman\".[117]',\n",
       " 'The Delhi police filed a charge sheet against the defendants on 13 March in the robbery of Ramadhir.[118]',\n",
       " \"The four surviving adult defendants went on trial in a fast-track court. The prosecution presented evidence including witness statements, the victim's statement, fingerprints, DNA testing, and dental modelling. It completed its case on 8 July.[10][119]\",\n",
       " 'On 10 September 2013, in the fast track court of Delhi, the four adult defendants were found guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence.[120] The four men faced the death penalty, and demonstrators outside the courthouse called for the hanging of the defendants.[115][121] The victim\\'s father also called for the defendants to be hanged, stating, \"We will get complete closure only if all the accused are wiped off from the face of the earth.\"[119] Lawyers for three of the four stated that their clients intended to appeal the verdict.[115] The four men were sentenced on 13 September to death by hanging.[12][122] Judge Yogesh Khanna rejected pleas for a lesser sentence saying the case has \"shocked the collective conscience of India\" and that \"courts cannot turn a blind eye to such crimes.\"[11][13] The victim\\'s family was present for the sentencing and her mother expressed satisfaction over the verdict saying, \"We were waiting with bated breath, now we are relieved. I thank the people of my country and the media.\"[123] After the verdict was delivered, the people waiting outside the courtroom applauded.[123]',\n",
       " 'Upon hearing that he would be executed, Vinay Sharma collapsed and pleaded with the judge, saying \"Please sir, please sir.\" As the men left the courtroom, they shouted out to the crowd \"Brothers, save us!\"[124][125]',\n",
       " 'While on death row, Mukesh Singh blamed Jyoti for being raped, saying \"You can\\'t clap with one hand ‚Äì it takes two hands. A decent girl won\\'t roam around at 9 o\\'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. About 20 percent of girls are good.\"[126] Singh also blamed Jyoti for her death, saying \"When being raped, she shouldn\\'t fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape. Then they\\'d have dropped her off after \\'doing her\\', and only hit the boy.\"[127]',\n",
       " 'On 13 March 2014, the Delhi High Court found each of the defendants guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence.
